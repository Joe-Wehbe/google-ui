# Project Description
This project is a simple but fully functional Google user-interface developed using `html` and `css` only, without any server-side implementation. It consists of three pages where each uses a specific query to fetch the results that would actually be displayed by Google:

## `index.html` 
Used for regular searching, and also features "I'm Feeling Lucky".
