# Project Description
This project is a simple but fully functional Google user-interface developed using `html` and `css` only, without any server-side implementation. It consists of three pages where each uses a specific query to fetch the results that would actually be displayed by Google:

- `index.html` used for regular searching, and also features "I'm Feeling Lucky". <br>
- `images.html` used for googling images. <br>
- `advanced.html` used for advanced searching. <br>
